Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again

Hello darkness, my old friend
你好黑暗，我的老伙计
I've come to talk with you again
我又来和你海阔天空神侃
Because a vision softly creeping
因为有个影子悄悄潜入
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
趁我熟睡埋下了它的种子
And the vision that was planted in my brain
这影子根植于我的大脑里
Still remains
至今还留在
with in the sound of silence
静默之声的地盘中
In restless dreams I walked alone
在不安的梦境中我独自游荡
Narrow streets of cobblestone
鹅卵石的街道狭窄幽长
Neath the halo of a street lamp
在一盏街灯的光晕下
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
我竖起衣领抵挡寒冷潮湿
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
就在我的眼睛被一盏霓虹灯的闪光刺穿的同时
That split the night
光芒划破了夜空
And touched the sound of silence
打破了这份静默
And in the naked light I saw
在孱弱的烛光中我看到
Ten thousand people, maybe more
成千上万的人们，或许更多
People talking without speaking
人们缄口却倾述心声
People hearing without listening
人们罔闻却声声贯耳
People writing songs that voices never share
人们写歌却从没嗓音分享
And no one dare disturb the sound of silence
静默之声没人敢打扰
"Fools" said I, "You do not know
“傻瓜”，我说，“你见识不长
Silence like a cancer grows”
静默像癌细胞一样生长”
Hear my words that I might teach you
有益的教诲你当听取
Take my arms that I might reach you
有助的臂膀你该挽起
But my words like silent raindrops fell
话语如雨滴悄然落下
And echoed in the wells of silence
在静默的源泉中久久回荡
And the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they made.
人们向自己塑造的霓虹神灵膜拜祈祷
And the sign flashed out its warning
告示牌上闪烁出神灵的警告
And the words that it was forming
若隐若现显示成行
And the sign said:
告示牌上写道：
"The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
“先贤们的箴言涂鸦在地铁的大墙
and tenement halls
以及公寓走廊上
And whispered in the sound of silence."
也在静默之声中被低声传送”
